# External Documentation

**Public-Facing Developer Documentation for RyzeSpace**

This section provides comprehensive guidance for third-party developers, integrators, and API consumers building on the RyzeSpace platform.

> [!NOTE]  
> External documentation focuses on **public contracts and integration patterns**. Internal implementation details are deliberately excluded.

---
## Purpose

External documentation serves developers who:
- Integrate with RyzeSpace APIs
- Build applications on the platform
- Consume RyzeSpace services
- Need to understand public guarantees and SLAs

**Goal:** Enable successful integration without requiring knowledge of internal architecture or implementation details.
